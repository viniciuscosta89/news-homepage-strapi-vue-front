### What I learned

I did this challenge to remember/recap my Vue knowledge. It's been years since I worked with Vue 2 and now Vue 3 it's a little different. It was nice to see the differences between Vue 2 and Vue 3. Since I was working with React the last years I found some similiar things between them. I found Pinia way better than Vuex. Vue-router and vue-query are very similar to their React counterparts.

The greatest challenge was align a 3-column row with a 2-column row on home page so they stay horizontally aligned.

I also had an opportunity to work with Strapi as my Headless CMS.

### Continued development

My plan is to get harder challenges to improve my Vue 3 knowledge.

### Useful resources

- [Docker with Strapi V4](https://blog.dehlin.dev/docker-with-strapi-v4) - This helped me with Strapi and how to host it somewhere, along the next link.
- [Deploy Strapi project on Fly.io](https://forum.strapi.io/t/fly-io-deployment/22438) - I'm a Front-end developer so I have to do a lot of research how to deploy the back-end part from my project.
- Documentations from Pinia, TanStack Query, Vue, Vite, Vou-Router and Strapi.
